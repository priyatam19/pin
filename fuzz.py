CVE-cjson-002
The cJSON library version 1.7.99 (artificially modified for the E-BOSS program) contains a vulnerability in cJSON.c inside the static cJSON_bool replace_item_in_object(cJSON *object, const char *string, cJSON *replacement, cJSON_bool case_sensitive) function. When the function is called with a cJSON *object that has an object->type that equates to cJSON_String (16), a double free occurs resulting in a crash.

        r"Your task is to generate an effective C fuzzing harness for the provided main function, suitable for use with AFL++, targeting the described vulnerability. The harness must be complete, valid C code and must not be empty.\n\n" +
        r"**Instructions:**\n\n" +
        r"1. **Analyze Input Mechanism & Pre-processing:**\n" +
        r"   * Examine the `main` function to identify how it receives external input (e.g., `fgets`/`read` from `stdin`, `read`/`fread` from files, `getopt`/`argv` for arguments, `accept`/`recv` for sockets).\n" +
        r"   * Note any loops processing input data (e.g., reading lines, parsing arguments, handling socket chunks).\n" +
        r"   * Identify pre-processing steps applied to the input (e.g., null termination, string splitting with `strtok`, type conversion with `atoi`).\n" +
        r"   * If the input mechanism is unclear, assume a simple input mechanism like reading a buffer from `stdin` with `fread`.\n\n" +
        r"2. **Identify Processing Target(s):**\n" +
        r"   * Determine the primary function call(s) or code block(s) within `main` where input data is processed. Note the expected data format (e.g., buffer, lines, parsed arguments).\n\n" +
        r"3. **Incorporate Vulnerability Targeting:**\n" +
        r"   * Use the vulnerability description to craft inputs that maximize the likelihood of triggering the vulnerability (e.g., malformed data, specific structures).\n" +
        r"   * Focus on input patterns relevant to the vulnerability without assuming library details unless explicitly mentioned in `main` or the description.\n\n" +
        r"   * Take into consideration the description of the vulnerability too while crafting the fuzz driver, i.e. the fuzz driver should be able to replicate the scenario which might trigger the vulnerability "
        r"4. **Generate Harness Code:**\n" +
        r"   * Create a complete C `main` function harness compatible with AFL++.\n" +
        r"   * Read a single test case from `stdin` (provided by AFL++).\n" +
        r"   * Simulate the input delivery and pre-processing steps from Step 1, converting the `stdin` test case into the format expected by the target in Step 2, while targeting the vulnerability from Step 3.\n" +
        r"   * For any functions defined in `main.c` (e.g., helper functions), include their full definitions (signature and body) directly in the harness and use them as needed.\n" +
        r"   * Implement AFL++ persistent mode (`__AFL_LOOP`, `__AFL_INIT`) if feasible, unless complex state dependencies prevent it.\n" +
        r"   * Include necessary headers exactly as they appear in `main.c` (e.g., same path, casing, and quotation style). Do not modify or guess header paths.\n" +
        r"   * Add error handling for critical operations (e.g., check `malloc`, `fread` returns). Return early for invalid inputs to focus on the vulnerability.\n" +
        r"   * Validate input data to prevent crashes (e.g., check buffer sizes, non-null pointers).\n" +
        r"   * Free all allocated memory to prevent leaks, especially in persistent mode.\n" +
        r"   * Handle edge cases (e.g., empty or oversized inputs) gracefully.\n\n" +
        r"5. **State Handling:**\n" +
        r"   * If `main` has persistent state (e.g., via loops or global variables), include a comment in the harness where state reset would occur in persistent mode (e.g., `/* Reset state here */`).\n" +
        r"   * Ensure resources (e.g., memory, file descriptors) are cleaned up across iterations.\n\n" +
        r"6. **Output:**\n" +
        r"   * Output **only** complete, valid C code for the harness, starting with `#include` directives and defining `int main` with a proper signature.\n" +
        r"   * Ensure the code is syntactically correct, compilable, and free of undefined behavior (e.g., no missing declarations).\n" +
        r"   * The output must not be empty. If unable to generate a complex harness, produce a minimal valid harness that reads from `stdin` and calls a processing function.\n" +
        r"   * Do **not** include comments, explanations, or markdown outside the C code.\n\n" +

        r"   * Note that the fuzz driver will read input directly from `stdin` using `fread` for binary/stream data or `fgets` for text, so seeds must match the primary functionâ€™s expected format, adjusted for direct `stdin` input.\n" +
        r"   * Identify any pre-processing applied to the input (e.g., null termination, string splitting, type conversion) and any constraints (e.g., buffer sizes, expected syntax).\n" +
        r"   * Determine the expected input format (e.g., null-terminated text, binary data, structured data like key-value pairs or JSON).\n\n" +
        r"2. **Incorporate Vulnerability Targeting:**\n" +
        r"   * Use the vulnerability description to guide seed generation. Focus on generating inputs that align with the conditions or patterns described (e.g., malformed data, oversized metadata, invalid syntax, or boundary values).\n" +
        r"   * Include inputs that test both valid cases (to exercise normal processing paths) and invalid/edge cases (to trigger the vulnerability).\n\n" +
        r"3. **Generate Seed Inputs:**\n" +
        r"   * Create at least 5 distinct seed inputs that match the expected data format identified in Step 1, tailored to trigger the vulnerability described in Step 2.\n" +
        r"   * Ensure diversity in seeds:\n" +
        r"     * **Valid Inputs**: Conform to the expected format (e.g., well-formed text, valid binary data, or structured data).\n" +
        r"     * **Malformed Inputs**: Include inputs with incorrect formats, special characters, invalid syntax, or oversized metadata that could trigger the vulnerability.\n" +
        r"     * **Edge Cases**: Include empty inputs, overly long inputs, inputs with boundary values, or inputs that exploit parsing limits (e.g., maximum buffer sizes or recursion depth).\n" +
        r"   * Represent seeds in the format expected by the primary function:\n" +
        r"     * For text inputs (e.g., strings, JSON), use plain strings, ensuring compatibility with null-termination if required.\n" +
        r"     * For binary inputs (e.g., compressed data), use hex-encoded strings to ensure binary compatibility with AFL++.\n" +
        r"     * For structured inputs (e.g., key-value pairs), use the appropriate delimited format (e.g., newline-separated or comma-separated).\n" +
