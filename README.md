üöÄ C Program Interface Normalization & Protobuf Wrapping Pipeline

Overview

This project provides a fully-automated pipeline to normalize the input interface of arbitrary C programs using Google Protocol Buffers (protobuf), enabling robust, schema-driven fuzzing and testing.

Key features:
	‚Ä¢	Automatically extracts input structs from C programs.
	‚Ä¢	Generates a matching .proto schema for input types (including nested/anonymous structs).
	‚Ä¢	Generates nanopb serialization/deserialization code for the C side.
	‚Ä¢	Auto-generates a main.c wrapper, deserializing protobuf input and calling your logic function.
	‚Ä¢	Supports both:
	‚Ä¢	Struct input (typedef struct { ... } MyStruct;)
	‚Ä¢	Single-field struct input (int, float, string) ‚Äî calls your logic as P(x) or P(s).
	‚Ä¢	Fully automates the build and execution process for new C programs, with no manual editing needed!

Pipeline Usage

1. Prepare Your C Program
	‚Ä¢	Use a typedef struct for your input, e.g.:

typedef struct {
    int id;
    float score;
    char name[32];
} MyStruct;

int P(const MyStruct* input, const char* name_buf);


	‚Ä¢	OR for single-value input:

typedef struct { int x; } Input;
int P(int x);


	‚Ä¢	Place your logic in a function named P(...) (the function name can be parameterized).

2. Run the Pipeline
	‚Ä¢	Place your C file in the repo (e.g. myprog.c).
	‚Ä¢	Run:

./full_pipeline.sh


	‚Ä¢	This will:
	‚Ä¢	Strip #include lines for parsing.
	‚Ä¢	Auto-generate .proto file(s), main.c wrapper, and input serialization script.
	‚Ä¢	Generate nanopb C code for serialization/deserialization.
	‚Ä¢	Compile everything.
	‚Ä¢	Generate a sample input.bin and run the program.

3. Adding/Testing New Programs
	‚Ä¢	Just replace the input C file and rerun the pipeline.
	‚Ä¢	The wrapper, proto, build, and input scripts are all regenerated from scratch!

What‚Äôs Supported
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Arbitrary nested/anonymous structs
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Multiple primitive field types: int, float, double, arrays, strings (char arr[N])
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Single-field struct inputs: string/int/float, with minimal wrapper logic
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Automatic buffer/callback handling for string fields (using nanopb)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Full build pipeline: proto ‚Üí wrapper ‚Üí nanopb ‚Üí compile ‚Üí run

‚∏ª

What‚Äôs Not Yet Fully Supported (Work in Progress)
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå C programs that do not use typedef struct for input (e.g. raw int P(int) or int P(const char* s)).
	‚Ä¢	Current workaround: wrap your function input in a struct typedef.
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Multiple input arguments in P(...) that are not part of a single struct.
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Support for pointers, enums, or unions in input struct.
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå C programs with global input variables (no input struct/function parameter).

‚∏ª

Next Steps & Planned Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Automatic support for function signatures with no struct
- Detects and handles int P(int) and int P(const char*) directly.
	‚Ä¢	Auto-generate .proto and wrapper for any C function signature, even if not using a struct typedef.
	‚Ä¢	Support more complex input types: pointers, arrays of structs, enums, unions.
	‚Ä¢	Smarter buffer length handling (auto-detect field lengths for string/arrays).
	‚Ä¢	Seamless integration with popular fuzzers (e.g., AFL, libFuzzer) for input coverage maximization.
	‚Ä¢	Better error handling and logging throughout the toolchain.
	‚Ä¢	Python-based end-to-end orchestrator for all steps (optional, for cross-platform/CI use).
	‚Ä¢	User-friendly CLI tool and config system for easy adoption.
