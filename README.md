## Overview

PIN (Program Input Normalization) is a tool designed to standardize the input interfaces of arbitrary C programs by transforming them to accept serialized byte inputs using Google Protocol Buffers (Protobuf). This enables uniform program analysis, optimization, and testing (e.g., fuzzing) across diverse input types, ranging from primitives (integers, floats) to complex structures (structs, pointers, arrays).

The project addresses the challenge of varying input spaces in program analysis by constructing a decoder function that maps bytes to the program's native input space, preserving semantics. As of August 19, 2025, PIN supports basic primitives, structs, nested/anonymous structs, strings, and arrays with both pycparser and libclang parsing backends. Recent improvements include enhanced string buffer handling and robust support for complex nested structs.

This tool is inspired by optimization-based program analysis techniques and aims to simplify pipelines for verification, fuzzing, and benchmarking. It is built with pycparser for C parsing, nanopb for lightweight Protobuf in C, and automated pipelines for end-to-end normalization.

## Motivation

Program analysis is complicated by diverse input interfaces (e.g., integers, strings, pointers, hybrids). PIN transforms any C program to accept inputs from a uniform domain (bytes), enabling standardized techniques like coverage-guided fuzzing or optimization solvers. This homogeneity drastically simplifies analysis, as highlighted in the project proposal.

## Features

- **Automatic Schema Generation**: Parses C code to extract input structs or function parameters, generating corresponding .proto files.
- **Decoder Composition**: Wraps the original program with nanopb-based deserialization to handle byte inputs.
- **Dual Parser Support**: Both pycparser and libclang backends for robust C code parsing
- **Support for Input Types**:
  - Primitives: int, float, double, bool.
  - Strings: char[] or char* as Protobuf strings with proper buffer management.
  - Arrays: Fixed-length as repeated fields.
  - Structs: Nested and anonymous structs as messages with cleaned naming.
- **String Buffer Handling**: Advanced nanopb callback system for complex string field deserialization
- **Pipeline Automation**: Full build process from C file to normalized executable, with random input generation for testing.
- **Differential Testing**: Automated comparison between original and normalized program outputs
- **Extensibility**: Modular for future additions like pointers (as optional/repeated), enums (Protobuf enums), unions (oneof).
- **Output Preservation**: Normalized binary produces equivalent outputs (e.g., printf) for equivalent inputs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ with required packages:
  - `pip install pycparser` for C AST parsing
  - `pip install libclang` for alternative parsing backend
- Protobuf compiler (`protoc`): Install via package manager (e.g., `apt install protobuf-compiler` on Ubuntu).
- Nanopb: Included as a submodule; run `git submodule update --init`.
- GCC for compilation.
- (Optional) Fake libc headers for pycparser: Clone https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/tree/master/utils/fake_libc_include into the project root.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/priyatam19/pin.git
   cd pin
   git submodule update --init
   ```
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install pycparser
   ```

## Usage

Run the pipeline script to normalize a C program:

```
./src/full_pipeline.sh <path_to_c_file> [function_name] [--parser=<pycparser|libclang>] [--headers-dir=<dir>]
```

**Parameters:**
- `<path_to_c_file>`: Relative path to the C file (e.g., examples/myprog.c).
- `[function_name]`: Optional; the function to normalize (defaults to "main"). For whole-program normalization, use "main".
- `[--parser=<backend>]`: Parser backend to use ("pycparser" or "libclang"). Defaults to pycparser.
- `[--headers-dir=<dir>]`: Directory containing custom header files for complex programs.

### Example Commands
- Normalize a simple function with pycparser:
  ```
  ./src/full_pipeline.sh examples/check_num.c checkNum
  ```
- Normalize a complex struct function with libclang:
  ```
  ./src/full_pipeline.sh examples/myprog.c P --parser=libclang
  ```
- Normalize with custom headers:
  ```
  ./src/full_pipeline.sh examples/mqtt.c main --parser=libclang --headers-dir=utils/user_headers
  ```

### Output
- Build artifacts in `build/<example_name>/` (temporary).
- Results (normalized binary `pin_test`, input.bin, output.log, .proto, .pb.c/h, main.c) in `results/<example_name>/`.
- Run the normalized binary manually: `./results/<example_name>/pin_test <serialized_input.bin>`.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Core scripts (full_pipeline.sh, pycparser_generate_proto.py, generate_wrapper_ast.py).
- `examples/`: Sample C programs (e.g., check_num.c, myprog.c, basename.c).
- `nanopb/`: Submodule for lightweight Protobuf.
- `build/`: Per-example build directories (temporary).
- `results/`: Per-example output directories with normalized binaries and artifacts.
- `fake_libc_include/`: Fake headers for pycparser to handle standard types.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `PIN_Proposal.pdf`: Original project proposal.

## How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: Strip includes and preprocess to create parseable C code.
2. **Parsing & Schema Generation**: Use pycparser to extract structs or function params, map to Protobuf schema (.proto).
3. **Random Input Generation**: Dynamic Python script fills the message with random values based on descriptors.
4. **Wrapper Generation**: Create main.c with decoder (nanopb) and call to original function.
5. **Nanopb Code Gen**: Generate .pb.c/h for serialization/deserialization.
6. **Compilation & Execution**: Compile original as object, link with wrapper and nanopb to produce pin_test, run with random input.
7. **Run & Results**: Execute with random input, store outputs.

## Current Status & Limitations

### âœ… **Completed Features**
- **Enhanced String Buffer Handling**: Fixed libclang parsing for complex nested structs with string fields
- **Dual Parser Support**: Both pycparser and libclang backends work correctly with proper type mapping
- **Anonymous Struct Support**: Proper handling and naming of anonymous/unnamed structs
- **Complex Nested Structs**: Full support for arbitrarily nested struct hierarchies
- **Comprehensive Type Mapping**: C primitive types correctly mapped to Protocol Buffer equivalents

### ðŸ”„ **Current Limitations**
- **Coreutils Programs**: Limited support for complex programs like basename.c, cat.c due to:
  - argc/argv normalization not implemented
  - Missing comprehensive GNU libc header system
  - Complex dependency chains and conditional compilation
- **Pointers**: Basic fallback to bytes; full support (optional, repeated, allocation) in progress
- **Enums/Unions**: Not yet mapped (enums to Protobuf enums, unions to oneof)
- **Global Variables**: Not handled in current implementation
- **Complex Memory**: No deep copy for pointers or cycles

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 2: Core Extensions (September 2025)
